              <h3>Project information</h3>
              <p>I made this project because I wanted to experiment with a home server. It was very educational and interesting because it also showed me the many advantages of a home server. I also learned a lot about virtualization and hypervisors.</p>

              <h2>Proxmox Home Server</h2>
              <p>My server was an old computer with not the best specs, I'm talking about 4gb ram and an old AMD Phenom processor. That's why my server is no longer on today because the hardware is just too bad.</p>
              <p>I started by completely cleaning my computer and installing proxmox. The server had 2 hard drives of 1 TB each and ran in a RAID 1 configuration, meaning one drive mirrored the other so I only had 1 TB in total storage but this makes the server much more secure should something go wrong.</p>
              <p>Then I started by installing a vm with Plex, which is actually a streaming service such as Netflix or Disney +, but with Plex you decide what is in the library. I myself don't have many digital movies that I could upload to my Plex media server so I didn't get to use it much, but I think the concept is great.</p>
              <p>Then I installed my own NAS distribution, namely OpenMediaVault. This used my raid 1 configuration so I shouldn't have set up a separate raid configuration for my NAS. A DIY NAS has many advantages, but also has a major disadvantage, which is that it does not offer remote access out of the box. And that is why I had to install my own VPN, namely OpenVPN.</p>
              <p>Then I installed my own Minecraft server with MineOS and an Apache web server to run locally for a while. And finally, I installed PiHole, which is an ad-blocking application aimed at blocking ads at the network level. PiHole acts as a Domain Name Service (DNS) server and as such queries all domains that try to access the devices connected to the network and blocks all ad servings.</p>
